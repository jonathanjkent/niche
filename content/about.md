Niche Analytics was founded by Jonathan Kent, a PhD social scientist with a passion for data analysis and a love of niche sports. Sports analytics has a bad rap these days and, frankly, it deserves it. In the beginning, advanced stats were developed by and for fans to help understand and appreciate the games they loved. But today, the tools invented on message boards have been co-opted by management consultant types. Appreciation is out, optimization is in. Performance might be up, but passion, spectacle, and joy---the reasons we play sports in the first place---aren't even part of the equation. Niche Analytics is here to change that.

We believe that data can be a power for good in sport. We build process-oriented training tools that help athletes enjoy the journey while reaching their potential. We help teams identify diamonds-in-the-rough, because there is nothing quite so satisfying as watching a home-grown phenom develop. And we help fans of niche sports and neglected leagues bask in the glory of upsets and comebacks, no matter the level.

If your team or league could use some data wizardry, reach out. We would be thrilled to help.
