Whether you call it Norwegian Singles, the Sirpoc Method, or just Sub-T, word on the street (well, r/AdvancedRunning) is that hobby jogging has been solved. The gist of the approach is that amateur runners can make big improvements if they focus on maximizing long-term training load while minimizing injuries. Consistent weeks, months, and years of sub-threshold workouts and true easy days will beat the ups-and-downs of stacking aggressive training blocks. That's the idea, anyway. The internet is bursting with success stories from those who have braved the monotony. But others have struggled to apply the method correctly or have lost patience. We created a (demo) dashboard to help Sirpoc's followers plan their workouts and track their progress, complete with a weekly report card.
